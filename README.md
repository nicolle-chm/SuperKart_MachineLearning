# SuperKart_MachineLearning
SuperKart is an fictional organization that owns a chain of supermarkets and food marts providing a wide range of products. They want to predict the future sales revenue of its different outlets so that they can strategize their sales operation across different tier cities and plan their inventory accordingly. To achieve this purpose, SuperKart has hired a data science firm, shared the sales records of its various outlets for the previous quarter, and asked the firm to come up with a suitable model to predict the total sales of the stores for the upcoming quarter.
